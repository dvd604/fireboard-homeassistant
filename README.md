HACS integration for Fireboard smart thermometers

Early proof of concept version showing device discovery, which adds a device for each FireBoard product in your account, and adds sensors for each channel, and drive percentage (if appropriate).

Tested with the FireBoard 2 (with drive cable) and Spark.
